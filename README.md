Demo applications for Lambda Music Sequencer

## [Simple Drum Machine](drum-machine)
A simple drum-machine build with a graphical user interface.

## [Midi Noise Filter](midi-noise-filter)

This is a MIDI signal filter for guitar synths. This program filters 
unnecessary short note-on/note-off events out which are very annoying for MIDI 
step recording in DAW.  This is an example to demonstrate how to modify 
incoming MIDI signals and send them again.
